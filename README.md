## Introduction to Node JS 

What is Node Js?
<br>
Node Js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
<br>
Node.js runs on the **V8 JavaScript engine** and executes JavaScript code outside a **web browser**.
<br>

- NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime built on **Chrome's V8** JavaScript engine.
- It is maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed outside a web browser.
- This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and browsers, Node.js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on servers, desktops, and even embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often described with the phrase "Run JavaScript Everywhere."
- Node.js features an *event-driven architecture* and supports *asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O).*

<br>
## Node.js History 
<br>

- NodeJS was built by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
- To run the JS, you always need a JS engine.
- Everywhere you write JS code, there is a JS engine that executes the code.
- Ryan started with the SpiderMonkey JS Engine, which is found on Firefox, but in two days he tried using V8 and never looked back.
- Earlier, Ryan was working independently, but there was a company named Joyent, and this company was working on something similar to NodeJS. They hired Ryan to work under them, saying, "Work with us, we will fund your project." He made a big contribution to Joyent Company.
- The earlier name of Node.js was Web.js, but Ryan Dahl later renamed it to Node.js because it was intended to be used for more than just web servers.
- **Apache HTTP Server** was a blocking server, so Ryan wanted to create a non-blocking server, which is why Node.js is a non-blocking I/O. The advantage of a non-blocking server is that it can handle multiple requests with a smaller number of threads.
- In **2010, NPM (Node Package Manager)** was introduced. NPM is a package manager for Node.js and it played a critical role in the success of Node.js. Without NPM, Node.js might not have become as successful as it is today.
- Initially, Node.js was built only for macOS and Linux, but in 2011, it gained support for Microsoft Windows as well.
- In **2012, Isaac Z. Schlueter** began maintaining Node.js; he is also the creator of **NPM.**
- In **2014**, a developer named **Fedor** created a fork of Node.js called **io.js**, which led to controversy within the company. As a result, 3 to 4 developers began maintaining the *io.js* branch.
- In **September 2015, Node.js** and **io.js** were merged, and the combined project was named the **Node.js Foundation.**
- In **2019**, the **JS Foundation** and the **Node.js Foundation** were merged to form the **OpenJS Foundation,** which now maintains Node.js.
